        "* In the late 1970s software became difficult to mantain and read. \n",
        "* Alan Kay a researcher at Xerox part came up with the idea of modeling programs after physical objects or complex systems.\n",
        "* Analogy of the body havinn different cells each having their own functions, but are still able to work together.\n",
        "* Many different objects with different functions that talk together. \n",
        "* Kay came up with the small talk language which was the first object oriented language. \n",
        "* Structured system where the whole system is consistent. \n",
        "* The messages were methods and the types of objects were called classes. \n",
        "* Ruby is inspired by small talk and the contemporary version of the language. \n",
        "* Python's object system is also influenced by small talk. \n",
        "* The design of object oriented programming was to think differently. \n",
        "* Java claims to be a purely object oriented program which is not technically true. \n",
        "* In python everything except the keywords in the language are objects.\n",
        "* Allows us to create new objects that behave in a certain way.\n",
